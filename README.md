As a self-taught guitarist, I am always looking for new ways to help improve my own skills. One aspect I want to work on is being able to transition between any two chord shapes seamlessly - which is why I created this simple web app. In essence, this web app allows the user to choose a key to practice in, a duration to practice for, and a BPM to practice with to allow them to train their ability to transition between any two chords within the key.
 # Features
 **Customizable Key:** The user is able to choose the key that they want to practice in, and the app will procedurally generate the chords that belong to the key and use these chords for the practice session.
 
 **Customizable Session Duration:** The user is able to choose how long they want to practice for in minutes and seconds.

**Customizable BPM:** The user is able to choose the BPM they want to practice in, either by tapping the TAP button in the tempo they desire, or by simply typing in their desired BPM.
